# About Jammming
[Jammming](lucitemple.github.io/jamming/) is a responsive react web app that uses the Spotify API to:
- display the user's Spotify playlists
- search for music tracks
- create a playlist
- save the playlist to the user's Spotify account.

This project was built for the [Codecademy Pro 'Front-End-Engineer'](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) career path, and Codecademy retains copyright of the web design and assets.
